### Welcome to the SpatialOS Unity SDK documentation

**New to the platform?**
You can:
* read about [what SpatialOS is (SpatialOS documentation)](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/concepts/spatialos)
* learn how to make a game with the [Pirates tutorial](tutorials/pirates/overview.md)

**Need some help?** Join us at [forums.improbable.io](https://forums.improbable.io) for technical questions and issues.

 **Note**:
SpatialOS 13.0 is fine for local development and deployments using the `small` [deployment template (SpatialOS documentation)](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/reference/file-formats/launch-config#templates), but deployments using larger templates may be unstable.

**License:**
See the [license](../LICENSE.md).

## Installing and upgrading
* If you are installing SpatialOS and the SpatialOS Unity SDK for the first time, see:
[Introduction to the Unity SDK](introduction.md).
* If you have a version of SpatialOS and the SpatialOS Unity SDK which is earlier than SpatialOS 13.0, you
have a combined SpatialOS and SpatialOS Unity SDK bundle. To get the separated version, see: [Upgrading to SpatialOS 13.0 and migrating to SpatialOS Unity SDK 1.0.0](migration.md).
