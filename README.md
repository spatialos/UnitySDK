**New from June 2018: The SpatialOS Unity GDK**<br/>
Check out the pre-alpha release of our new Unity GDK: [source code on GitHub](http://github.com/spatialos/UnityGDK). Using the Unity Entity Component System (ECS), the GDK is the next evolution in SpatialOS Unity game development. See our [blog post on ECS-powered multiplayer](https://improbable.io/games/blog/unity-gdk-our-first-steps) for more information.<br/><br/>
**Note:** The pre-alpha GDK version is available for evaluation and feedback only. It's not yet game-development ready.

Together with the SpatialOS [spatial CLI](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/spatial-cli-introduction), the SpatialOS Unity SDK
allows you to use [Unity](https://www.unity3d.com) to create games for the [SpatialOS](https://improbable.io/games) platform.
